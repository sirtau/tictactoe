## How to Play
You can either click on the board to place a move, or use the Random Move button to simulate AI gameplay.

1 Player - Simply only click on the game board. 
2 Players - Click Random Move in turn of either X or O. 
0 Players - Keep clicking Random Turn for endless fun! 

## Planning
I drew a simple 3x3 grid for reference, then wrote code based on what I wanted to do to make the game function.

## Known Bugs
None! Please try to break it. Thank you!


## My Experience Developing the Game

I took it slow and tried to break things down into parts. I'd build on code and would check that it was working as each new elements were added. Then by considering how things interacted, I was able to debug, improve and add new features along the way.

Initially had the game logic just write to the board and check it directly, but moved towards an array to make things modular enough to let me code in things like alternate X/O elements later if desired.
